For the PIF - I used a vector that stored a pair of string(the token) and pair of int and int(the position in the hash table)

I used a hash table for the symbol table. That is because it has an O(n/TABLE_SIZE) search complexity with TABLE_SIZE being a really large number.
For The hash function I simply add the ASCII codes for the characters and then mod the result by TABLE_SIZE.
I only have one member function called add that only adds the given token if it is not already in the table.
The function returns a pair representing the position of the token in the table.

The splitting was done based on the following regex:
"((,)|(\\+)|(\\-)|(\\*)|(\\/)|(<=)|(==)|(>=)|(=)|(<)|(>)|(\\[)|(\\])|(\\()|(\\))|(;)|(\\{)|(\\})|(:)|(])|( ))"
This regex matches all separators.

The regex for matching identifiers is:
"[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*"
An identifier can only contain letters, numbers and underscore but it must start with a letter.

For numerical constants:
"([1-9][0-9]*)|0"
Numerical constants are unsigned and - used for negative numbers is a unary operator.

For string literals:
"\"[a-zA-Z0-9]*\""
String literals can not contain spaces or any other separators.
